    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I pride myself on my use of leftovers, and I'm constantly trying to impress Michele with my ability to “reimagine” recently made dishes, and some of my best work in that area has featured cut up, already roasted meat, which I've turned into a pasta or noodles. So, that's sort of what I was going for here, except I cooked the beef from scratch, specifically for this.</p>
        <p>I'm sure we could get something similar by cutting up the beef first, and then browning it, before making the sauce as shown, but something tells me it wouldn't be quite the same. How? No idea. That's the mysterious nature of food that still excites me, even at this advanced age. That aside, as I said in the video, if you've not yet discovered the magic of miso, this is a great way to get familiar. So, for that reason alone, I really hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
